# Overview

This bundle deploys three charms to show a proof of concept deployment
of Grafana monitoring with an InfluxDB backend.

Grafana is a general purpose dashboard and graph composer.  It can be used to
visualize monitoring data for your environment.

This bundle is a test and should not be used in production.

# Usage

Once the bundle has deployed, you can access the grafana interface at the
public interface shown from juju status.

To view the data generated by the influxdb-injecter charm, click on the title
of the first graph and then click edit.  The series name to select is
series-<public address of influxdb unit>.  

The following video shows how to generate the graph in grafana:

# Feeding more data into influxDB

The influxDB charm currently has a static port for feeding data into grafana: 8217.
Data should be sent on this port to the influxDB host in the following format:

<metric path> <metric value> <metric timestamp>

The metric path is the series you will select in grafana to graph the data.
